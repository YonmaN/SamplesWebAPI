WebAPI Samples application
==========================

Zend Server's extensive Web API covers all of the available functionality Zend Server provides. By connecting to the Web API you can reach and connect to the services on Zend Server and integrate it into applications and external services to automate your processes.

This package of samples provides you with at least a working understanding of how the Web API works and how we thought you would connect to and use it.

The samples break down into three sections:
* Basics - explanations on how to actually connect to the Web API.
* Simple workflows - some easy to use Web API actions to get your started.
* Advanced workflows - Web API actions which require more than one step to actually be used effectively.

The samples package also contains information about another Zend project - Zend Server Web API Module. This module can be dropped into any ZF2 application and be used to make integration even easier.
